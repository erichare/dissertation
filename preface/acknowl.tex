\specialchapt{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

Although I can't possibly acknowledge everyone who has had a positive impact on my academic career, I would like to give a few special shoutouts.

First, to the men and women at the TIBCO Software Seattle office, who offered me the internship which led me to discover my love of statistical computing.

Second, to the Iowa State Department of Statistics, who believed in my ability to conduct research and earn a PhD before I did, and were the first to give me the opportunity.

Third, to my parents Elizabeth and Edward, who despite having PhDs of their own, never pressured or expected me to follow in their footsteps, but supported me all along.

Fourth, to my girlfriend Rainie, who ventured with me to the frozen midwest in pursuit of a PhD of her own, helping to make all this possible.

Fifth, to all my friends I've met in Ames,  who helped ease my transition to Iowa State and make me immediately feel comfortable and happy here.

Sixth, to my friends back home in Seattle who have stuck by me as I left them for five years to do research.

Last but absolutely not least, my major professor, Dr. Heike Hofmann, who has been the best mentor I could have hoped to find.
