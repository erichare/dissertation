# My Dissertation

My dissertation for a PhD in Statistics (Co-Major in Computer Science) at Iowa State University

## Title

Enabling Scientists to Understand Their Data using Web-based Statistical Tools.

## Outline

1. Automatic Matching of Bullet Lands
2. Introducing Statistics with intRo (or bullets follow-up paper)
3. A Web Framework for Rapid Deployment of Visual Inference Studies

## Proposal (Containing Lit Review)

My proposal to the committee of what im going to do (15 pages):

Roughly 12 pages other people's work, 3 pages what i will do.

1. Review literature (show that we know the literature and what I'm talking about)
2. Point out where literature is inadequate
    a. Working between statistics and computer science - All the tools we would use. Focus on the things that go beyond Shiny, but may be generalizable - Things that I see myself doing with every one of the applications. Show that i can adapt and create something new. biology, stats ed, forensics science
    b. The statistics itself - Bullets, composition of a lot of smaller data analysis self. Outline each step, and talk about transparency of the process and getting things online (x3prplus, x3p files). This needs to be a pretty major cultural shift - No more black boxes.
    c. The computer science itself - Interface design. Read "The Design of Everyday Things"
3. Cover bullets and visual inference literature (about 10 papers for visual inference total)

Read through literature with 2009 report in mind (Careful with how we cite Bachrach - Say it is stated in this paper, not that it has been shown)
    
## TODO (8/22/2016)

1. Email Mike about RStudio Server and CC Heike
2. Send out whenisgood for committee, two hour blocks, week of September 19th (Ask Jess when prelim form needs to be submitted). Proposal goes out a week ahead of exam.
3. Prepare slide deck for prelim - begin with background academic info, focus on one of the papers, sketch out other two. Timeline for other papers, what i'm going to work on. 40 minutes approximately.
4. Proposal will have bullet paper as pdf. Literally paste it at the end.
5. Dissertation: Chapter 0 (Lit Review, proposal). Each application will be 1 chapter. Chapter X at the end will be a conclusion, outcome, high level. Future work as well in this cahapter.

## Lineup Notes

Big Dream: Providing lineup service to the public

Organize Framework for generating lineup experiments

1. Picture Details -> Database (Link between stimuli and responses + demographics)
2. Uploading pictures
    a. Check feasibility of uploaded images, give warnings
3. Sampling Schemes
    a. Theoretical Framework: Interaction between randomization and stratification
    b. Simulate in order to check theory
    c. Provide Examples / Choices
4. Provide P-Values based on sampling scheme
