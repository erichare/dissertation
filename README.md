# My Dissertation

My dissertation for a PhD in Statistics (Co-Major in Computer Science) at Iowa State University

## Title

Enabling Scientists to Understand Their Data using Web-based Statistical Tools.

## Outline

1. Automatic Matching of Bullet Lands
2. Introducing Statistics with intRo (or bullets follow-up paper)
3. A Web Framework for Rapid Deployment of Visual Inference Studies

## Proposal (Containing Lit Review)

My proposal to the committee of what im going to do (15 pages):

Roughly 12 pages other people's work, 3 pages what i will do.

1. Review literature (show that we know the literature and what I'm talking about)
2. Point out where literature is inadequate
    a. Working between statistics and computer science - All the tools we would use. Focus on the things that go beyond Shiny, but may be generalizable - Things that I see myself doing with every one of the applications. Show that i can adapt and create something new. biology, stats ed, forensics science
    b. The statistics itself - Bullets, composition of a lot of smaller data analysis self. Outline each step, and talk about transparency of the process and getting things online (x3prplus, x3p files). This needs to be a pretty major cultural shift - No more black boxes.
    c. The computer science itself - Interface design. Read "The Design of Everyday Things"
3. Cover bullets and visual inference literature (about 10 papers for visual inference total)
    
## TODO

1. Read through literature with 2009 report in mind (Careful with how we cite Bachrach - Say it is stated in this paper, not that it has been shown, since the findings are... crap.)
