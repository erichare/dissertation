# My Dissertation
My dissertation for a PhD in Statistics (Co-Major in Computer Science) at Iowa State University

## Outline

"Statistics, Computer Science, and the Bridge"

### Chapter 0 - Lit Review

Ideas:

* Good designs of GUIs
* History of Statistics and Computing
* R didn't initially get recognition, until nobel prize for mathematics

### Chapter 1 - Theoretical Considerations for Visual Inference
This chapter covers the Statistical Methodology portion of my dissertation

Ideas:

* Scenarios of simulation - How do you present lineups?
* '?Exchanging null plots, dependency in lineups?'
* Tie into giving domain experts access to statistical tools

### Chapter 2 - Web-Based Applications for Visual Inference and Data Science
This chapter covers the Computing portion of my dissertation

Computational Statisticians make data science a reality - We can pull applications from chem, biology, statistics, and enable people to do statistics in their domain...It's up to computational statisticians to make statistics available to domain experts. We can't leave it at the hand of comp sci, (they dont have stats or domain knowledge)

### Chapter 3 - The Interface Between Statistics and Computer Science
This chapter covers the Statistical Computation / Data Science portion of my dissertation
