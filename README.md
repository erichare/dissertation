# My Dissertation

My dissertation for a PhD in Statistics (Co-Major in Computer Science) at Iowa State University

## Title

Enabling Scientists to Understand Their Data using Web-based Statistical Tools.

## Outline

1. Automatic Matching of Bullet Lands
2. Introducing Statistics with intRo (or bullets follow-up paper)
3. A Web Framework for Rapid Deployment of Visual Inference Studies
    
## Lineup Notes

Big Dream: Providing lineup service to the public

Organize Framework for generating lineup experiments

1. Picture Details -> Database (Link between stimuli and responses + demographics)
2. Uploading pictures
    a. Check feasibility of uploaded images, give warnings
3. Sampling Schemes
    a. Theoretical Framework: Interaction between randomization and stratification
    b. Simulate in order to check theory
    c. Provide Examples / Choices
4. Provide P-Values based on sampling scheme

## TODO 

- Span smaller than our original smoothing (5, 10, 15, 20, 25), plus NIST style
- Give script to Dr. Hofmann
- Send slides from NIST to Dr. Hofmann
- Use Cary persistence to show declining probabilities as a function of the number of repetitions
- Show pictures of the above
